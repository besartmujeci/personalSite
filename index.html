        On a day
        <br>
        <br>
        when the wind is perfect,
        the sail just needs to open and the world is full of beauty.
        Today is such a day.
        <br>
        <br>
        My eyes are like the sun that makes promises:
        the promise of life
        that it always
        keeps
        each morning.
        <br>
        <br>
        The living heart gives to us as does that luminous sphere,
        both caress the earth with great
        tenderness.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is a breeze that can enter the soul.
        This love I know plays a drum. Arms move around me;
        who can contain their self before my beauty?
        <br>
        <br>
        . . .
        <br>
        <br>
        On a day when the wind is perfect,
        the sail just needs to open
        and the love starts.
        <br>
        <br>
        Today is such
        a day.

      <h1>About</h1>
      <div class="m-auto">
        As a master's degree student at USC and an Albanian-American, I am dedicated to pursuing excellence both
        academically and personally. With a passion for code, coffee, and literature, I am always looking for ways to
        expand my knowledge and challenge myself.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in my field and gained valuable experience through
        internships and projects. I am a hardworking and detail-oriented individual who is committed to delivering
        high-quality work and making a positive impact in the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy staying active and exploring new places. I am an avid reader and writer,
        and I love discussing ideas and sharing my thoughts with others. Whether I am participating in a coding
        challenge, sipping on a latte, or delving into a great book, I approach every task with enthusiasm and a desire
        to learn.
        <br>
        <br>
        With a dedication to excellence and a passion for personal growth, I am excited to see where my journey will
        take me next.
